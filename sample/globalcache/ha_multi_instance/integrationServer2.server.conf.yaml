# Integration server configuration file for use as global cache container
# Provides an equivalent to the "Muti-Instance" Cache Policy XML configuration in previous versions of IBM Integration Bus and Websphere Message Broker
# Uses two integration servers (1 and 2) that are both a catalog server and a container server
# It also uses an integration server (3) which is a container server; this integration server must be part of a multi-instance integration node
# A multi-instance integration node cannot be used to host an integration server with a catalog server
#
# General notes :
#  - Integration Server will load server.conf.yaml from directory set via --work-dir
#  - To ensure valid YAML avoid any use of TAB characters
#  - File paths may be taken as absolute, or relative to the integration server's work directory
