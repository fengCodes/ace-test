# Integration server configuration file for use as global cache container
# Provides an equivalent to the "default" configuration in previous versions of IBM Integration Bus and Websphere Message Broker
# Uses four integration servers where one is both a catalog server and a container server, and the other three are container servers
#
# General notes :
#  - Integration Server will load server.conf.yaml from directory set via --work-dir
#  - To ensure valid YAML avoid any use of TAB characters
#  - File paths may be taken as absolute, or relative to the integration server's work directory
